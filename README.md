# Simple Github App

This is a simple application which allows a user to search for users and view a paginated list of the results.
They can view other such information as the avatar(if there is one), username, full github profile, followers, stars and those the user is currently following.

### Questions

* I really enjoyed working on the pagination and figuring out how to make it work with the Github API.
* I also enjoyed making my search field automatic(so as you type, you see results).
* I am most pleased with how well it looks and works and how structured the code is.

Given more time, 
* I would add some more extensive tests and add other features like advanced search filters to have a more specific search.
* I would make it so that a user can follow users from the UI without going to github
